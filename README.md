**Architecture of Top Down ElasticStack Deployment**

![Architecture](docs/Sample%20full%20elasticStack%20deployment.png)

**Prerequsites**

1. Ensure that you are running a Kubernetes cluster with version greater 
than 1.9 by issuing the command

        kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1

    The result should be
    
        admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
        
2. Kuberenetes client version (kubectl) version greater than 1.12

3. The project is written using Go. Install Go for you OS by reffering the
following link https://golang.org/doc/install

4. The project uses dep as the dependency management tool for Go. Install dep 
by the following command

        go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
        
5. Docker is used to create the container. It can be installed from https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ ( Ubuntu users ) or  https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ ( Windows Users )

6. A Dockerhub account is required to push the MutatingWebhook Image to a 
central repo

7. For the mutatingwebhook to work the namespace must be injected with the following labels by using the following commands
         
        kubectl label namespace ${namespace} namespace=${namespace}
        kubectl label namespace ${namespace} sidecar-injector=enabled
        
**Building the Docker Image**

To build the Docker Image issue the following command

        ./build
                
**Description of resource files**

1. filebeatyaml.yaml :- Contains the configmap of the filebeat.yml file
2. injectionConfigmap :- Contains information of the details that would be injected into the containers
3. logconf.yaml :- Contains the Logstash.conf file describing the pipeline of the Logstash container
4. logpath-configmap.yaml :- Contains details of the log path locations of the contains which need sidecar injection. 
Additionally contains any environment variables that need be added
5. logstash-collector.yaml :- Main deployment of the Logstash Collector
6. Logstash-service.yaml :- Expose the Logstash container
7. Logstash_s3_secrets.yaml :- Secrets for aws crednetials in Logstash s3 output plugin
8. logstashyaml.yaml :- Configmap containing the logstash.yml file
9. mutatingwebhookConfiguration.yaml :- Contains the mutatingwebhookConfiguration
10. mutatingwebhookDeployment.yaml :- Contains the mutatingwebhook Deployment
11. mutatingwebhookService.yaml :- Contains the service for exposing the mutating webhook
12. create-cert.sh :- Create Generate certificate suitable for use with an sidecar-injector webhook service.

**All resource files are generated under the assumption of helm is being used to create
the deployment**

**Installation**
1. [Through Helm](docs/HELM_INSTALLATION.MD)
